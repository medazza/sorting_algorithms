# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Overview

This C language project provides implementations of at least four different sorting algorithms. It also aims to help you understand and evaluate the time complexity of these algorithms, choose the best sorting algorithm for a given input, and learn about stable sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort (Bonus)

Each sorting algorithm is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations in the source code.

## Big O Notation and Time Complexity Evaluation

Understanding the efficiency of sorting algorithms is crucial. The project explains Big O notation, a way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. You will learn how to evaluate the time complexity of each sorting algorithm, enabling you to make informed decisions when selecting an algorithm for a specific problem.

## Selecting the Best Sorting Algorithm

Different sorting algorithms excel in various scenarios. The project provides insights into how to choose the best sorting algorithm for a given input. Factors to consider include the size of the input, the initial order of elements, and the available memory.

## Stable Sorting Algorithms

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is considered stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they were in the original input. The project explains the concept of stable sorting algorithms and highlights which of the implemented algorithms are stable.

Happy sorting!
